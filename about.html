                  <p>With enough intelligence to predict with accuracy, the onset of conditions that increase forest fires before they get out of handle or even begin, allow rescue teams to respond faster while enabling first responders to manage targeted evacuations better and more aligned to the real situation in the field. This concept may also fit with the flood detection or, earthquakes and other natural disasters.</p>
